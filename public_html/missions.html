								<p>Though difficult, it is necessary to be united with the global church. This is what Christian unity means— that we should unite with believers from all nations so that we can sow seeds and reach the hearts of those at the edges of the world. Through the Great Commission, we are all called to the missions field, whether it is here at home or overseas. How can we respond to this calling so that we can engage in meaningful cross cultural relationships and be beacons of light in our world?
								</p>
		
								<p>Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age." 	Matthew 28:19-20 (NIV)

								<h3>Vivian's Guatemala Trip 2014</h3>
								
								<p>Going to Guatemala definitely felt like the right step in my faith journey. Though God closed a door that summer, He opened so many others to enable me to go to Guate. Now that I’m looking back at the progression from the trip, I realized that many more doors were opened exactly because of what I learned and experienced there. Living life immersed in a different culture allowed me to tangibly hear that the call to follow Jesus means we are to extend beyond mere sympathy when engaging in cross cultural interactions and that Jesus’ love for us allows us to extend this same love towards our global neighbors no matter what country they come from or the community they identify with. This trip left me with more than just memories but rather a passion to encourage others to obey the call to missions, the courage to speak out about the issues of the global church, and the vocabulary to deliver the thoughts God has impressed upon my heart.

								<p>In Guatemala, we taught VBS, encouraged the local Chinese Alliance Church, and helped with construction of a home for Roman and his family. Here is a little reflection from my last day:
								“On the last day of the trip, as the tires pulled away from the curb, my mind ran as fast as the car did- flashbacks to all the wonderful memories made in the quaint little side alleys, the woman selling baby ducks at the end of the street, the little town square where I played soccer and basketball with my students. Instead of feeling unhappy however, I felt a reassuring calmness in my heart knowing that these kids are well cared for here and that God is moving so tangibly in this community. </p>

								<p> I went to bed with a feeling of satisfaction and completeness that God has been glorified on this trip- a feeling that supersedes the physical pains in my muscles and the emotional struggles of leaving a country that I've grown to love. As I boarded my flight and looked out at the contrast between the pilots checking the dials and whistles of the control panel down to the  ground crew preparing the plane for take off, I was reminded that everyone is called to bear a different, but no less important part of the cross. Pertaining particularly to missions- while some people may never be called to go on a missions trip personally, they play no less of a role in the expansion of the Kingdom. They can support missionaries financially and also be part of a church that sends missions teams abroad. My hope is that God will stir the hearts of our local community to realize the importance of their partnership with the global church, to experience worship from every tribe, nation, people, and language, and to participate in the reconciling work of the cross that tore down the divisions in our world.

								<h3>Vivian's Project Shine 2015</h3>
								
								<p>I've taught a lot of students throughout the years but my class in Rongshui was the hardest working group I've ever encountered. English is hard for them and when I was correcting their homework, grammar and spelling mistakes were too many to count. However, instead of feeling disappointed by their lack of English skills, these students tried even harder! They used their breaks and lunch times to ask us questions in English and  practiced speaking with their peers in their free time. Day by day, they didn't need us to translate as many words for them in class and I can really see their progress through the time we were there.</p>

								<p>Although we were there to teach them English, our students in many ways, taught us more. Throughout the two weeks, we were showered with kindness and smiles- a simpler way of looking at life. Although our students don't have very much, their community and relationships with each other gives them everlasting wealth. They've taught me to appreciate the people around me and to take hold of each moment-- to try my best when I am in a difficult position and to realize how lucky I am to live here in Canada.</p>

								<p>At the end of our two weeks, we were able to have one-on-one conversations with our students. During this time, they shared with us their stresses of life, family, dreams, and hopes for their futures. Many of our students were overjoyed that strangers that don’t even know them would fly across the country for two weeks to teach them English. They realize the privilege they have by being in the Project Shine program and feel loved by the time and effort we put in-not only into our teaching but also in connecting with each and every one of them on an individual level. So at the core of this program is love-- the all encompassing and unconditional love that comes only from our God. What moved my students most was seeing this overflow of love in the way we interact with them and how, by our actions, we mirror, if only by a small fragment the kind of love we experience from our Abba Father. By sacrificing a little bit of time, I had the opportunity to share what my students proclaim as an unexpected and overwhelming kind of love. Through this experience, I discovered more about the world formed by our Creator, grew in my Spiritual journey, and helped introduce students to our amazing God!
